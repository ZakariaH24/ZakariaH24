My name is Zakaria and this is my github page.
This is the beginning of my journey in data analytics.
I want to use this page to showcase the many project I have done with Hyperiondev who have helped jump start my career in data analytics.
I am intersted in sports and want to use data analytics to understand it in a more technical fashion.
Thank you very much in taking the time out of your day to check my page out.
Enjoy
Zakaria
